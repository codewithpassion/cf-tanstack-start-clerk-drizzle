Can you analyze how the application is architected, including:
- Cloudflare backend
- Use of Drizzle for data access
- Backend services
- Usage of tRPC
- React Router loaders and actions
- Frontend structures

The goal is to write an architecture definition to aid future development using Claude Code. Once you have all the details planned, I want you to write a markdown file to `/ai_docs/architecture.md`. Add as much information as possible to speed up future developments. 
Focus on the development process, specifically anything that helps agentic coding tools like Claude code to learn about the architecture  quickly. 
Think deeply
